## About the About Page

This site is intended to serve as a resource for information about books of hours and certain information about Medieval Western European life associated with them. It is primarily designed to serve as a repository for scans of a book of hours in the collection of the Lilly Library at Indiana University Bloomington. It also serves the secondary purpose of providing information about the life of Western European individuals that helps add to the richness of a personâ€™s understanding of a book of hours. Links to other relevant sites and information regarding those sites will also be provided. I hope to enlighten those who know little about the subject of books of hours, as well as to spark a connection for those who would not normally be interested in the subject. I also wish to provide this information for the benefit of those who have a passing interest in the topic as well as professionals who practice in the fields of art, literature, medieval history, and any other area of study which concerns a book of hours.

Content is written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and enhanced using "includes" that pull in collection content, external media, and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) features like cards and modals.
We hope this makes it easier for site builders to develop the collection AND add interesting and engaging contextual information. 

Each "include" file has several options, which are documented in the files themselves--copy the examples to see how it works with your content! 
In the demo below, we've given display widths of 25% and 50% to save space, but you can feature the entire image or document.

You can also see a page featuring [a bonanza of feature includes options](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/collectionbuilder-gh/feature_options.html) on our CollectionBuilder-GH demo site. 

{% include feature/button.html text="Feature *Includes* Bonanza page" link="https://collectionbuilder.github.io/collectionbuilder-gh/feature_options.html" color="primary" size="lg" centered=true %}
